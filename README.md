Symmetry Detectives Example

For a discrete dynamical system, symmetry detectives (Barany, Dellinitz, Golubitsky 1993) provide a way to numerically determine the symmetry of a discrete dynamical system. In the following code, I work out an examples of how symmetry detectives can determine the symmetry of an attractor for a discrete dynamical system with varying parameters. Disclaimer: I think there are some mistakes in my code.
